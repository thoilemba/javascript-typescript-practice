# Object

Objects are complex data types that allow you to store collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier and each value can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, and arrays.

- **Creating Objects**: You can create objects using object literals, constructor functions, or the Object.create() method.
- **Accessing Properties**: You can access properties of an object using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).
- **Modifying Properties**: You can modify the properties of an object directly by assigning new values to them. `person.age = 35;`
- **Adding Properties**: You can add new properties to an object by simply assigning a value to a new key. `person.gender = 'Male';`
- **Deleting Properties**: You can delete properties from an object using the delete operator. `delete person.city;`
