# Data Types
**There are 7 primitive datatypes in Javascript.**

1. ***Number:*** Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. Its value range from `-2^53 - 1` up to `2^53 - 1`.
2. ***String:*** Represents sequences of characters (text).
3. ***Boolean:*** Represents a logical value indicating true or false.
4. ***Undefined:*** Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
5. ***Null:*** Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
6. ***Symbol:*** Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), symbols are unique and immutable data types, often used to create unique identifiers.
7. ***BigInt***: It is used to store large integers. It is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer. It represents integers of arbitrary size, so it doesn't have a specific range limit.
